# Add Panels Projects

This projects use two Deep Learning architectures to detect add panels over outdoor images. The two architectures used have been **Single Shot Detector**(SSD) and **You Only Look Once**(YOLO).

For more detailed information see:

## The repository is organized as follows:

- **docs:** contain a copy of the Master's Thesis.
- **results:** contains a few test images with the detection results obtained with SSD and YOLO architectures.
- **samples:** contains a few original test images used to show the detection results.
- **sources:** contains the config files and jupyter notebook files for testing both architectures.
